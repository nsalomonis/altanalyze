= Introduction =

"Ensembl ([http://www.ensembl.org http://www.ensembl.org] is a joint scientific project between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, which was launched in 1999 in response to the imminent completion of the Human Genome Project with scientists in the United States, the international consortium comprised geneticists in China, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Its aim is to provide a centralised resource for geneticists, molecular biologists and other researchers studying the genomes of our own species and other vertebrates. Ensembl is one of several locations for the retrieval of genomic information. Similar databases and browsers are found at NCBI and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)."

AltAnalyze gene and constitutive annotations are largely based on Ensembl gene, transcript and exon models. These models are augmented with transcript data from the [http://genome.ucsc.edu UCSC genome database].

Databases (AltDatabase) built from Ensembl in AltAnalyze are versioned (e.g., EnsMart55)
