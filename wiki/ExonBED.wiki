#summary Example Exon BED format

== Example Exon BED Format ==

Below is the column format used in the exon-level BED file recognized by AltAnalyze. When a .bed file containing these 10 fields is imported, AltAnalyze will assume the data are detected exons from your experiment. This can be RNA-seq or even an unsupported microarray. Default expression is non-log read counts but can be log2 (select format as log in AltAnalyze). The notes field can include any or no information.
