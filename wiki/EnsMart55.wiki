#summary Ensembl versioned database directories

= Introduction =

For all Affymetrix annotation updates, the corresponding Ensembl version supported by Affymetrix is used as the basis for building a new AltAnalyze database (species specific). Although Affymetrix provides probeset-Ensembl associations, all Ensembl associations are derived by the AltAnalyze developers using genomic coordinates provided by Affymetrix and Ensembl to determine probeset-Ensembl relationships (overlapping genomic coordinates). Updated versions of the AltAnalyze database (AltDatabase) are provided through the main menu by selecting "Get new species/vendor/array databases online" and "Continue".
