#summary FAQ-AltAnalyze Visualization Options

===_How can I visualize splicing and domain level changes from AltAnalyze?_===

_*Answer*_: Two Cytoscape plugins are in development to allow for users to take AltAnalyze result files (exon-inclusion-results.txt file) and view AltAnalyze splicing scores in the context of a (1) gene structure graph (SubgeneViewer) or (2) protein domains and microRNA binding sites (DomainGraph). DomainGraph is included along with Cytoscape and dependent plugins in version 1.15 of AltAnalyze and later as well as from the plugins menu (Plugins>Manage Plugins>Network Inference) in Cytoscape.

[SubgeneViewer] is currently in development but should be released in the near future.
