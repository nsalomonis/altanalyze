#summary FAQ-Event Call Description

===_Why do all alternative exons have the indicator "exon-inclusion" in the column "event_call"?_===

_*Answer*_: Some users are confused by this column, since for exon arrays, all probesets have the annotation exon-inclusion. This column was added for junction arrays, in which some probesets are supplied with the annotation "mutually-exclusive" in addition to "exon-inclusion". Exon inclusion only indicates that the probeset measures exon-inclusion, but does not indicate whether there is more exon inclusion or exclusion. In most cases, users can ignore this column.
