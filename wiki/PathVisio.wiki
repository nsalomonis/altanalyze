#summary PathVisio Description

= Introduction =

PathVisio is a tool for displaying and editing biological pathways. In a sense PathVisio lets you draw pathways as you would in any drawing program, like PowerPoint or Photoshop. But the difference is that PathVisio can understand the biological context of a pathway, because you can link biological entities (genes or proteins) in your pathways to biological data using database identifiers. This will let you map experimental data (e.g. microarray data) and visualize it on top of the pathway drawing. Note: mapping experimental data is not yet a feature of PathVisio 1.1, but you can do this in combination with GenMAPP or with additional plug-ins for PathVisio).
