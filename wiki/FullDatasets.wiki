#summary FullDatasets Description

The directory FullDatasets is created to store filtered probeset expression values for all groups and all samples, irregardless of the specific comparison being run. This file is used for multigroup comparison analyses (3 or more). Unlike pairwise comparisons, where a probeset or junction must be expressed sufficient in one group (user defined) or two groups when used for constitutive calculations, probesets or junctions retained in the FullDatasets file must only be expressed in one biological sample group.
